Path of Building Pricing Assistant

<b>Currently in very early stages of development.</b>

This tool aims to assist a user in pricing out a Path of Building's cost. 
It does this by creating trade links for each gem and unique item in a build.
There is also an auto pricing function which will automatically calculate the expected cost of each item. 
The auto pricing process takes a long time, each item takes ~20 seconds of time to price. 
Any faster than that and the user will risk being rate locked from poe trade. 

To operate this tool a user will need to provide a POESESSID details found here: 
http://www.vhpg.com/how-to-find-poe-session-id/
Please note that sharing a POESESSID can be risky.

Eventually I hope to be able to use the poe oauth and remove the requirement for the POESESSID completely.

As stated above this is in very early stages of development ideas, help and comments are welcomed. 

Thanks for checking out PoBShopper
